# HotelProgram

This repository contains a hotel program that is done for my university coursework. It is a console program written in Java. Moreover, this is my first project following the main Object Oriented Programming concepts. This program has the ability to,
* View customers, 
* Add new customers to rooms,
* View empty rooms,
* Delete customers from a rooom,
* Find guests from name,
* Store and load data from an external file, and
* View guest names arranged in alphabetical order

In this system, if the hotel is full the guests will be added to a waiting list/ or a queue. Then once a guest checksout (deletes) from a room the fiest in the queue will be added to that room.
